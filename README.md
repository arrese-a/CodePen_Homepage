# Coding Foundations final project

Replica of `CodePen.io` homepage.

The index page is divided in 4 main sections: <br>
1. Navigation wrapper
2. Content
3. Footer
4. Final black block

Each section has each own css file, except `4. Final black block` which is styled in `footer.css`. <br>
In addition, `media-queries.css` file has been added so the homepage can be visualized in a narrow screen, such as a phone screen.
